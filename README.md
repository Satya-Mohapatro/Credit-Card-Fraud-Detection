# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection using Gradient Boosting

A complete **end-to-end ML pipeline** using **XGBoost within sklearn pipelines** to detect credit card fraud, featuring:

âœ… Clean pipeline structure  
âœ… Hyperparameter tuning with `RandomizedSearchCV`  
âœ… SHAP-based interpretability (optional)  
âœ… Deployment with **Streamlit**  
âœ… Demonstrable on **Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face Spaces**

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Credit card fraud detection is a **highly imbalanced classification problem** where the goal is to **identify fraudulent transactions with high recall** while managing false positives.

This project:
- Uses the [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
- Builds a robust pipeline using **XGBoost for Gradient Boosting**.
- Deploys a **Streamlit app** to allow users to upload transactions and receive fraud predictions interactively.
